My Rock Paper Scissors game!

In this project I used html and bootstrap to create a basic layout and then javascript to link in and apply the game logic. The computer picks rock, paper, and scissors at random each time the user clicks their choice, then the game logic compares the cpu and player choices and updates the score to the page as well as the outcome.
